      <h2 second-head>Why use composition API Vue 3 ?</h2>
      <p>
        The world of web development is constantly evolving, with new tools and
        frameworks regularly emerging to help developers build more efficient
        and effective applications. Among these is Vue.js, a popular JavaScript
        framework used for building user interfaces. With the introduction of
        Vue 3, developers now have access to the Composition API, a new and
        powerful feature that offers several benefits over the traditional
        Options API. This article will explore the advantages of using the Vue 3
        Composition API in your next web development project.
      </p>
      <h3 third-head>Introduction to Vue 3 Composition API</h3>
      <p>
        Before we delve into the benefits of the Composition API, it’s essential
        to understand what it is. The Composition API is a set of additive,
        function-based APIs that allow flexible composition of component logic.
        It was introduced in Vue 3 as an alternative to the Options API, which
        has been a standard part of Vue since its inception.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Options API is based on a declarative syntax that partitions your
        component into different options: <span class="tages">data</span>,
        <span class="tages">computed</span>, <span class="tages">methods</span>,
        <span class="tages">watch</span>, etc. While this approach is excellent
        for small to medium-sized components, it can become challenging to
        manage when dealing with larger components or complex logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where the Composition API comes in. It provides a way to use
        Vue’s reactivity system outside of components, which allows you to
        manage and encapsulate logic in a more maintainable way.
      </p>
      <h3 third-head>Benefits of Vue 3 Composition API</h3>
      <h4 sub-head>Improved Logic Reusability and Organization</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most significant advantages of the Composition API is its
        ability to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components. With
        the Options API, sharing stateful logic between components often
        required the use of mixins or higher-order components, which could lead
        to conflicts and complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the Composition API enables you to extract reusable logic
        into functions that you can import and use in any component. This not
        only promotes logic reusability but also enhances code organization, as
        related code can be grouped together, making your components easier to
        understand and maintain.
      </p>
      <h4 sub-head>Better TypeScript Support</h4>
      <p>
        If you’re using TypeScript in your Vue applications, you’ll appreciate
        the improved support offered by the Composition API. The Options API’s
        dynamic nature often led to subpar TypeScript inference, but with the
        Composition API, you get excellent TypeScript support out of the box.
        This leads to better type checking and autocompletion, enhancing
        developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of bugs.
      </p>
      <h3 third-head>Enhanced Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        As your application grows in complexity, so does the challenge of
        managing state and logic. The Composition API excels in this area, as it
        allows you to organize your code in a way that makes it easier to scale.
        By encapsulating related logic and state within composable functions,
        you can manage complex applications more effectively.
      </p>
      <h3 third-head>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The Composition API in Vue 3 is a powerful tool that offers numerous
        benefits, making it a compelling choice for any Vue developer. Its
        emphasis on logic reusability, improved TypeScript support, easier
        testing, and enhanced scalability provides a solid foundation for
        building robust, maintainable, and efficient applications.
